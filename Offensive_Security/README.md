* [Vocab & Frameworks](./Vocab_&_Frameworks.md)

## Resources

* [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten): The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.
* [PTES - Penetration Testing Execution Standards](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Main_Page)
  1. **Pre Engagement Interactions**: Preparation documentation & determining tools
  2. **Intelligence Gathering**: Gain info from external sources like google and social profiles (aka OSINT - Open Source Intelligence)
  3. **Threat Modeling**: Typically skipped
  4. **Vulnerability Anaysis**: Active engagement to gather info
  5. **Exploitation**: Active engagement to break target with identified vulnerabilities
  6. **Post Exploitation**: Attet to keep control of the system for investigaton or exploitation later 
  7. **Reporting**: Articulate findings to client in an unerstandable manner
