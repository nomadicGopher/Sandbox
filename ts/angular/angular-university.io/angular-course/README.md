_Uses CSS with no SSR, SCR or router features. This was created manually & not a fork of [https://github.com/angular-university/angular-course](https://github.com/angular-university/angular-course)._

1. Ensure node is installed
2. `npm install -g @angular/cli`
3. `ng new angular-course` (fresh install. `ng add ...` can be used to add to an existing project.)
5. `npm start` (runs `ng serve` for a dynamically updated dev environment pointing to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200))

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.1.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
