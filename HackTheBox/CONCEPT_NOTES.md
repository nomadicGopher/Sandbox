## TCP vs UDP

TCP is generally used for applications requiring reliable, ordered data transmission. The most common TCP ports include:

* HTTP/HTTPS (ports 80 and 443) for web browsing
* FTP (port 21): File Transfer Protocol for transferring files
* SMTP (port 25): Simple Mail Transfer Protocol for outgoing email
* SSH (port 22): Secure Shell for secure remote administration of devices
* Telnet (port 23): Specifically designated for Telnet, which is designed for command-line interface access to remote systems
  * root, admin, administrator may be default user names, which may also have a blank password

UDP is preferred for applications prioritizing speed and low latency over perfect reliability. Common UDP ports include:

* DNS (port 53): Domain Name System used for domain name resolution
* DHCP (port 67): Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for issuing IP addresses
* NTP (port 123): Network Time Protocol
* VoIP (port 56): Voice over Internet Protocol used for phone conversations
