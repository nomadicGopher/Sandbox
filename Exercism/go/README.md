* 🟠 card-tricks (arrays, slices & variadic parameters)
    * _Variadic parameters like sample(nums ...int) allow functions to accept any number of arguments of a specified type. You can call such functions with individual values (e.g., sample(item1, item2)) or by expanding a slice using ... (e.g., sample(slice...)). The ... is necessary to satisfy the variadic parameter when passing a slice. This is different from when the function is expecting a slice, like sample(nums []int), where you simply pass the slice (e.g., sample(slice))._
